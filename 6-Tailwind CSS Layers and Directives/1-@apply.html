        Tailwind CSS Layers in style.css File

    Tailwind CSS organizes its styles into three primary layers: 
            1- Base 
            2- Components
            3- Utilities 
    These layers allow you to structure your styles in a maintainable and hierarchical way, 
    ensuring predictable behavior when styles overlap or override each other.

    Tailwind Layers
        1- Base Layer
            -> Contains styles that provide defaults for basic HTML elements.
            -> Similar to a browser's "reset" or "normalize" stylesheets.
                Example:
                    css
                        h1 {
                            font-size: 2rem;
                        }
        2- Components Layer
            -> Used for reusable components or higher-level UI patterns.
            -> Includes styles for specific design patterns like buttons, cards, etc.
                Example:
                    css
                        .btn {
                            padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
                            border-radius: 0.25rem;
                        }
        3- Utilities Layer
            -> Contains single-purpose utility classes for styling (e.g., p-4, text-center, bg-blue-500).
            -> These classes are most commonly used when writing Tailwind styles directly in your HTML.
                Example:
                    html
                        <div class="text-center text-xl bg-gray-200">
                            Hello
                        </div>


    Directives in Tailwind CSS
        1. @tailwind
            -> This directive is used to include the Tailwind layers (base, components, and utilities) 
               into your CSS.
                Example:
                    css
                        @tailwind base;
                        @tailwind components;
                        @tailwind utilities;
            -> Why Sequence is Important:
                The order matters because:
                    - Base styles provide foundational defaults.
                    - Components build on or override base styles.
                    - Utilities provide the most specific styles and override components if necessary.
                    - If the order is incorrect, styles may behave unpredictably.
        2. @apply
            -> Allows you to apply Tailwind utility classes within your own CSS file to create custom styles.
                Example:
                    css
                        .btn {
                            @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
                        }
            -> Why It's Useful:
                - Reduces repetitive utility classes in HTML.
                - Helps create reusable, maintainable styles.
        3. @layer
            -> Used to add custom styles to a specific Tailwind layer (base, components, or utilities).
                Example:
                    css
                        @layer base {
                            h1 {
                                @apply text-2xl font-bold;
                            }
                        }
                        @layer components {
                            .card {
                                @apply shadow-lg p-4 rounded bg-white;
                            }
                        }
                        @layer utilities {
                            .bg-gradient {
                                background: linear-gradient(to right, #4facfe, #00f2fe);
                            }
                        }
            -> Why It's Important:
                - Ensures your custom styles integrate seamlessly into the Tailwind framework.
                - Maintains proper layer hierarchy, so custom styles override.
        4. @config
            -> Used to import another Tailwind configuration file within the current configuration.
                Example:
                    css
                        @config "./tailwind.custom.config.js";
            -> Why It's Useful:
                - Helps modularize and manage configurations for large projects.

    <!-- 
        -> sequence are matters in CSS file
            The sequence in a CSS file matters because styles are applied in the order they appear, following CSS's cascading
            and specificity rules. Here's why:
                Later styles override earlier ones if they target the same elements with equal specificity.
                    css
                        p {
                            color: blue;
                        }
                        p {
                            color: red; /* This takes effect because it comes later. */
                        }
